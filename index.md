Welcome to my learning experience design portfolio. Here you’ll get an idea of the range of my skills and how I think about designing learning. In this portfolio, I link you to a learning asset, and use contextual copy to expand on my design decisions: why and how the decisions could support certain kinds of learning.

<h2>About me</h2>

I am an experienced educator and writer with 10+ years of experience designing and facilitating in-person and online learning in the education and humanitarian sectors.<br>

My goal has always been to collaborate with others and bring out the best in people and situations, whether I have been based in Cape Town, Winnipeg, La Ceiba—Honduras, Mexico City, or Bucaramanga and Cali—Colombia.<br>

Not a day goes by without research and writing in English, Afrikaans, or Spanish. It could be writing for:<br>

**Online learning**
+ Constructive, specific, justified, and kind comments while quality assuring the accessibility, and pedagogical and academic integrity, of SAICA- and SAQA-accredited online degrees, or short courses<br>
+ Learning plans and materials, video scripts, graphics briefs, and SCORM interactions for online and blended short courses on conflict transformation, operations management, leadership coaching, supervised machine learning, sustainability, digital transformation etc. with global universities (HEC Paris, LSE, NUS, UCT, UNAB)<br>

**Humanitarian projects**
+ Project proposals, narrative and MEL reports, and evaluations in the NGO sector<br>
+ Team policies, procedures, and templates<Br>

**Personal projects**

+ Reviews of professional and personal development books for my [blog](https://goodnbadhowto.com "The good, the bad, the how to")<br>
+ Quirky or serious stories, like “Daily Bread” that reached the second round of judging, and was in the top 7 percent of short stories submitted to the 2023 Bridport Prize<br>

Voluntarily organizing TEDxBucaramanga in 2015 around the theme of “Everyday acts of heroism”, showcases how you can depend on me to leverage my love of learning, penchant for sharing relevant information that highlights local agency, and commitment to social justice to build a better world for others.<br>
