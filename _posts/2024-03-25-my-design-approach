## Introduction
As I approach a learning design, I am always thinking about how to design for:
1. The realities of the learner;
2. The demands of the content; and
3. The needs of the production and implementation teams.

In the next section, I describe the principles that I apply while designing with these three aspects front of mind.

## Principles Regarding the Learner's Reality
One of the best ways for learners and educators to be partners on a learning journey is to take the learner's reality into account and design accordingly. Content must be accessible, inclusiive, and respond to how learners learn best.

### Accessibility
- Accessibility means designing for the hardware learners have access to, as well as their internet and data access.
  - For example, given the historical context in South Africa, it is likely reasonable to assume that learners will often access the learning management system (LMS) via mobile phones. Therefore, the user interface must use responsive web design to be mobile-compatible.
  - Unless they are able to do some of their learning at work, learners are likely using their own data. Streaming videos and interactive content can be slow and use a lot of data. HD resolution should be avoided to speed up the download times and economise data usage. Also, where alternative activities and elements can be used equally well, they should replace data-heavy elements. Use gifs in palce of screencasts as one example.
- Provide downloadable content and transcripts so that students can work offline if needed, like during the commute home on public transport, or at home if they only have internet access at work.
- Include affordances in the user interface, such as alt text, adequate colour contrast, font size, button size, sufficient white space to avoid a wall of text, readability for assistive technologies, etc.
- Affordances should be clear and easy to follow for learners who may be older and feel less confident using technology, or learners who are engaging with online learning for the first time.
- It's advisable to follow the web content accessibility guidelines (WCAG) as a benchmarch for making content accessible in an online environment.

### Learning Experience
- Learners learn best when learning includes thinking, doing and feeling. Any learning journey should include activities with opportunities for including all three areas. Managing cognitive load and emotional load is important if learner are to remain engaged.
- Chunking content into modules, units, activities, and sections and subsections within activities, helps to manage cognitive load.
- Many working learners have work and family responsibilities, especially females taking courses. This implies that they may complete course work in small chunks. Each activity, or component, whithin the learning journey should be easy to complete in less than an hour. Otherwise, learners may feel despondent if daily life interrupts a task and they have start all over again.
- The activities in the learning journey should contain a balance between prior knowledge and challenge; if the challenge is too great, learners will experience cognitive overload with overwhelming feelings, and may give up or freeze.
- English may be a second or third language for many learners. Therefore, the English used should be simple yet elegant to manage cognitive load so that learners understand without feeling humiliated or talked down to. Language usage is as much an accessibility consideration as a learning experience one.

## Principles related to the demands of the content
Many qualifications have clear requirements that learners must meet. Therefore, the content requires that learners can prove they can do certain things. The most imporante design principles here are backward design and scaffolding.

### Backward design
- Backward design means starting with what learners should be able to do once they complete the course and the programme. These skill can be written up as learning outcomes and objectives. With those goals in mind, the content can be scaffolded to reach them.

### Scaffolding
- Scaffolding means creating a learning journey with elements that build on one another, going from foundational concepts to higher order thinking.
- Scaffolding should be present in the broad design, and within micro-design. At the highest level, learning outcomes and objectives should be scaffolded using a learning taxonomy, for example, Bloom's Revised Taxonomy.
- Scaffolding within a micro-design can be achieved through chunking, as previously described.

### Academic integrity
- Use the clear standards for learner competencies and topics that a qualification should adhere to as a checklist for the learning design.
- Support all the examples provided, problems with model answers, readings, discussions, etc., with academically sound, current, and reputable sources.
- Use proper referencing and citation to avoid plagiarism. This also models ethical and professional behaviour that learners and citizens should embody and practice.

## Principles related to the needs of the production and implementation teams
Time is a non-renewable resource that neither learners nor educators can get back. Educators can only do one thing at a time, so if the design forces them to go beyond scope, there are things they must leave aside. Design principles need to respect and care for people's professional and personal commitments and well-being. Design principles also need to take the resources and contraints into account. Two important principles in the regard are to keep content evergreen, and be efficient.

### Evergreen content
Course maintenance is time-consuming and labour-intensive. Therefore, develop content using the folloing best practice:
- Provide relatable examples and scenarios that stand the test of time.
- Specify time and dates, especially in media assets that are costly, complex, and time-consuming to update. Avoid using "last year" or "next month", for example.
- Link out to reputable websites that are stable over time.

### Efficiency
- Stay within the scope governed by the learning objectives and learning times. This has the added benefit of managing cognitive load as well.
- Choose activities strategically to effectively meet the learning objective and scaffold properly. This will elminate burdening tutors and support staff with avoidable learner queries because the activity will effectively convey the content.
- Use the simplest, yet quality method, to convey content given the available production staff, as well as the budget and tools.
- Use activities and features that can be built in-house as far as possible since independent contractors tend to be costly.
- Consider how to assess learning outcomes with learners without place the buld of the load on tutors and graders. Use quizzes, and discussions (a form of peer review) where content allows for this.
- Design activities that are easy to upload and maintain on the LMS.
